# Automatic-Local-Outlier-Factor-Tuning
Local outlier factor (LOF) is one of the state-of-the-art models used for anomaly detection, but the predictive performance of LOF depends greatly on the selection of hyperparameters. In this paper, the authors propose a novel, heuristic methodology to tune the hyperparameters in LOF.
